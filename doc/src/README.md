# EVM Toolkit (ETK)

The **EVM Toolkit** (or _ETK_) is a collection of tools for creating and analyzing smart contract programs on the [Ethereum Virtual Machine][evm]. So far it consists of an assembler (`eas`) and a disassembler (`disease`).

ETK is new, and highly experimental. Use at your own risk.

## Tools

### Assembler: `eas`

The assembler lives in the [`etk-asm`] crate, and provides a command-line interface (`eas`) and a Rust library. The assembler has a couple notable features:

 - Importing multiple files into the same scope, for organization.
 - Including files in a separate scope, for constructors and initialization code.
 - Automatic push size selection.
 - [Solidity-style function selectors][selectors].

### Disassembler: `disease`

The disassembler lives in the [`etk-analyze`] crate, and also provides a command-line interface (`disease`) and a Rust library. The disassembler is much more experimental, and has a limited set of features:

 - Disassemble hex or binary encoded instructions into their mnemonics.
 - Identify basic blocks.
